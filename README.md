# Am I Behind?

This is a small extension that shows you a notification if you are opening a
project and there are new changes on the remote.

It is highly advised to run this extension with the configuration
`"git.autofetch"` set to `true`, so that you will get notified without having
to manually run `git fetch` all the time.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
